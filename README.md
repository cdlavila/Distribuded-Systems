# Distribuded Systems
This repository contains socket all concepts and problems worked in Distributed Systems Course, using the Python language.

The projects are:
- Sockets
- Sockets with JSON and XML
- RPC

As a recommendation, don't run several projects at the same time, because you are going to have problems with the ports.
